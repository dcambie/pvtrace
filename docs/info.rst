History
-------

pvtrace v2.0 has been totally re-written in 2019 by Daniel Farrell.

pvtrace v1 to v1.3 was originally written between 2008-2010 as apart of my PhD studies in luminescent solar concentrators with contributions from (in no particular order),

 * Carl Poelking (Constructive Solid Geometry),
 * Karl C Godel (Convex objects, Faces, and Polygons), 
 * Markus Fuhrer (povray scene rendering and multiprocessing), 
 * Amanda Chatten (Windows friendly paths),
 * Dario Cambie (Bug fixs)
